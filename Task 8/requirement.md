# Task 8: Build a Chatbot using if-else

## Description
Create a rule-based chatbot that responds to user input using conditional logic.

## Objective
Build a conversational chatbot that uses if-elif-else statements to provide intelligent responses based on user queries.

## Tools
- Python

## Deliverables
- Python script that simulates a chatbot
- Rule-based conversation logic
- Input/output loop for continuous interaction
- Exit mechanism

## Hints/Mini Guide
1. Use `input()` for user queries and loop for continuous conversation
2. Use `if-elif-else` statements for pattern matching and responses
3. Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
4. Use `in` operator to check for keywords in user messages
5. Implement a quit/exit command to end the conversation
